# DiffChecker 

A simple text comparison tool.

**NOTE**

There are many tools to do text comparison on the internet but we don't know what's really going on with the data in the background
I we have sensitive information to compare then we might consider some tool like this that runs locally and doesn't share data anywhere.



### Run the app locally
```bash
# clone the app
npm install
npm start
```


### Run the app in docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Go to http://localhost:4567
